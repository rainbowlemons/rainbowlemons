- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rainbowlemons
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game dev!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Godot and I'm familiar with Python.
- I plan to participate in some game jams and will upload some source code here. 
- I'll also upload anything I make with Python. I hope to help contribute to open source projects!
